## Game rules:

- Player has one dice/card at a time
- There are two buttons that the player uses to decide whether the next card/dice number will be higher or lower 
- Once the player chooses one of the options, he/she gets 0.1 point for the correct answer and a new dice/card is shown
- There should be 30 rounds of the game

## Assumptions

- API https://deckofcardsapi.com/.
- The card/dice should be represented by a picture
- History of all the rounds and results has to be created and shown
- The number of remaining rounds and the sum of points have to be visible
- Closing the app saves the current game
- If the game is resumed, the player gets a question “Reload the previous game?”
- If the player chooses “YES”, previously saved game is reloaded
- If the player chooses “NO”, a new game starts
- The project does not have time limitation, however it should not take more than a few hours
- Any tools, frameworks, librialiers or packages can be used to complete the task
- Submit the project the way you do when working with a team
- This repository is created exclusively for your recruitment process and you can interact with it the way you like

## Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
